# AF Module Project

This is a project developed for the AF module in year 3 semester 1. It is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A document-based database used to store data.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to build the backend API.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces used to build the frontend.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used to run the backend server.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in both the frontend and backend directories.
3. Start the backend server by running `npm start` in the backend directory.
4. Start the frontend development server by running `npm start` in the frontend directory.

The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
