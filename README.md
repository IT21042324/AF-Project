# AF Module Project

This repository contains the source code for a project developed as part of the AF module during the 1st semester of our 3rd year. The project is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: A document-based database used to store data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js used to build the backend API.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces used to build the frontend.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to run the backend server.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by navigating to both the `client` and `backend` directories and running `npm install`.
3. Start the backend server by navigating to the `backend` directory and running `npm start`.
4. Start the frontend development server by navigating to the `client` directory and running `npm start`.

The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
